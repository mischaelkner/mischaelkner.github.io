<h1> Mischa Elkner </h1>

<p>Welcome to my website! I am a second year PhD student in the <a href =  https://hausel.pages.ist.ac.at/>Hausel Group</a> at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria. My e-mail address is mischa[dot]elkner[at]ista[dot]ac[dot]at. </p>

<p>Before starting my PhD, I studied mathematics at the University of Vienna. There, my BSc thesis was supervised by <a href = https://www.mat.univie.ac.at/~cap/>Andreas Cap</a> and my MSc thesis by <a href = https://shantanudave.com/math-a11y/>Shantanu Dave</a>.</p>

<p>I am interested in Lie theory and its interplay with algebraic and differential geometry. My PhD project is in geometric representation theory, with a focus on natural representation-theoretic symmetries. Using the recently introduced <a href = https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02711>big algebras</a>, I am studying such symmetries geometrically. Concretely, this involves working with affine Grassmannians, in particular their real forms and equivariant cohomology.</p>

<p> My other mathematical interests include combinatorial representation theory, algebraic topology, and &#8212; less seriously &#8212; replacing the name <i>KÃ¤hler manifold</i> with <i>Dreifaltigkeit</i>. </p>

<li> My <a href = "MSc thesis.pdf"> master's thesis </a> (2022) was in noncommutative geometry in the sense of Connes. I filled in details for the computation of cyclic cohomology for noncommutative tori, following Ryszard Nest. </li>
