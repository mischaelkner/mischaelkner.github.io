<p>Welcome to my website! I am a second year PhD student in the <a href =  https://hausel.pages.ist.ac.at/>Hausel Group</a> at the Institute of Science an Technology Austria.</p>

<p>Before starting my PhD, I studied mathematics at the University of Vienna. There, my BSc thesis was supervised by <a href = https://www.mat.univie.ac.at/~cap/>Andreas Cap</a> and my MSc thesis by <a href = https://shantanudave.com/math-a11y/>Shantanu Dave</a>.</p>

<p>I am interested in algebraic and differential geometry and their interplay with the structure and representation theory of Lie groups. My PhD project is in geometric representation theory, with a focus on natural representation-theoretic symmetries. Using the recently introduced <a href = https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02711>big algebras</a>, I am trying to study such symmetries geometrically.</p>

<h2> Research </h2>
<li> <em><a href="Draft__On_involutions_of_minuscule_Kirillov_algebras_induced_by_real_structures.pdf">On involutions of minuscule Kirillov algebras induced by real structures</a></em> (2024, preprint) </li>
<li> My <a href = "MSc thesis.pdf"> master's thesis </a> was in noncommutative geometry in the sense of Alain Connes. I filled in details for the computation of cyclic cohomology for noncommutative tori, following Ryszard Nest. Though different in the details, this experience in noncommutative geometry has been helpful for work in algebraic geometry. </li> 

<h2> Other publications </h2>

<li> In a class on Lorentzian geometry, we saw that the (semi-Riemannian) exponential map on (anti-)de Sitter space is not surjective. The same is true for the (Lie theoretic) exponential map for SL(2,R). As it turns out this is essentially <i>the same example</i>/, which I rediscovered and showed in <a href = "SL_2_R__as_anti_de_Sitter_Space.pdf"> this note</a>.
