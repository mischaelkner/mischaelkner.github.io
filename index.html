<p>Welcome to my website! I am a second year PhD student in the <a href =  https://hausel.pages.ist.ac.at/>Hausel Group</a> at the Institute of Science an Technology Austria.</p>

<p>Before starting my PhD, I studied mathematics at the University of Vienna. There, my BSc thesis was supervised by <a href = https://www.mat.univie.ac.at/~cap/>Andreas Cap</a> and my MSc thesis by <a href = https://shantanudave.com/math-a11y/>Shantanu Dave</a>.</p>

<p>I am interested in algebraic and differential geometry and their interplay with the structure and representation theory of Lie groups. My PhD project is in geometric representation theory, with a focus on natural representation-theoretic symmetries. Using the recently introduced <a href = https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02711>big algebras</a>, I am trying to study such symmetries geometrically.</p>
